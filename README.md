# LifeExpectancy

A model that will predict the life expectancy of a specific demographic region based on the inputs provided. Various factors have a significant impact on the life span such as Adult Mortality, Population, Under 5 Deaths, Thinness 1-19 Years, Alcohol, HIV, Hepatitis B, GDP, Percentage Expenditure, and many more. Users can interact with the system via a simple user interface which is in the form of a form with input spaces which the user needs to fill the inputs into.

## Application

Life expectancy is the primary factor in determining an individual's risk factor and the likelihood they will make a claim. Insurance companies consider age, lifestyle choices, and several other factors when determining premium rates for individual life insurance policies. It can be used by researchers to make meaningful researches out of it and thus, bring about something that will help increase the expectancy consider the impact of a specific factor on the average lifespan of people in a specific country.

## Used
+ IBM Cloud to host the ML model
+ IBM Watson provides the api to host the model
+ Node-Red flows to build the web interface to interact with the hosted model
